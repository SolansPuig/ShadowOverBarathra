# Shadow Over Barathra

A graphical (kind of) Roguelike using the DawnLike Tileset. This project is mainly for learning purposes and for fun.
The most important thing for the game is the world of Barathra to feel really alive.

I've not yet decided whether the levels will be randomly generated or hand-made. 


In the future I'll create another similar game, this time (maybe) closed source, based on the world and mechanics of Shadow Over Barathra.
